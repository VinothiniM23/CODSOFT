# Student-Grade-Calculator

This repository contains a simple Java program developed using NetBeans IDE 20 for calculating student grades based on marks obtained in each subject. The program prompts the user to enter the marks (out of 100) for each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a letter grade. The results are then displayed to the user.

# Features
  * **User Input:** Takes user input for marks obtained in each subject.
  * **Total Marks Calculation**: Calculates the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects.
  * **Average Percentage calculation**: Computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
  * **Grade Assignment**: Assigns letter grades based on the average percentage achieved.
  * **Result Display**: Shows the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding letter grade to the user.
# Technologies Used
  * **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the student grade calculation logic.
  * **NetBeans IDE 20**: The integrated development environment used for Java application development.
  * **GitHub**: The repository is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration features.
