# Student-Grade-Calculator
   This repository contains a simple Java program developed using NetBeans IDE 20 for calculating student grades based on marks obtained in each subject. The program prompts the user to enter the marks (out of 100) for each subject, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a letter grade. The results are then displayed to the user.
